<div class="blurb">
<p>I have graduated with an MEng in Computer Science (First Class Honours) from Imperial College London, while interning at Palantir, Facebook (6 months) and Bloomberg. During my 4th year at Imperial I have mainly focused on ML-related courses, such as Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, ML for Imaging, Mathematics for ML or Computational Optimisations. I have also been a Teaching Assistant in Discrete Maths, Algorithms and Logic during my 3rd and 4th years.</p>
